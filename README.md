# Monte Carlo Integration using C

Common examples along with a simple script (using Python)
for rendering deviation versus N runs.

I have abstracted the randomise position and condition
from the Monte Carlo function with the intent of providing alternatives.

In this case I have implemented various conditions with tests.

TODO : Implement alternative position generating methods.

## Suggestions

* A 3D grid technique
* Spherical, Cylindrical and Circular randomisation
